        content creator at BritishPandaChick. I specialize in building WordPress
        websites with PHP. I love building the front-end components on web applications
        with JavaScript, NodeJs, and MongoDB. I have 9 years of experience teaching,
        designing curriculum, and adjusting content to fit academic content standards
        as well as meeting learning goals. I am looking for a full-time remote

        <p>I organize the overall plan for web applications. I create PSD
          design comps with Adobe Photoshop for WordPress websites. I decide
          the layout, fonts, and colors for web applications. I use design tools
          such as Canva and Visme to create web graphics for websites.</p>

        <p>I transform design comps into live web applications. I build web
          pages, menus, and forms accessible to all users. I write clean, semantic,
          well formatted code so other devs can access, troubleshoot, and collaborate
          with no issues.</p>
